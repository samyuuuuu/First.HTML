                      <p>According to measurements from the University of Oxford, a desktop computer with a screen in use uses about 40W of electricity. This was lowered to 15W when the equipment was not in use and 2W following a shutdown thanks to power-saving features. Turning off the desktop at the wall socket would save the last 2W.</p>
                  <ul>
                   <li>This indicates that although power-saving settings cut power consumption by around 50 percent, switching off at the wall reduces wasted consumption even further.  </li>

                   <li>Turn off their desktop at the end of the day to cut their annual GHG emissions by 69 kg CO2e.  </li>
                   <li>For safety concerns, turn off laptop chargers overnight and remove them from the device.</li>

Many electronics manufacturers and retailers have programs for recycling used devices. For example, HP's Recycle Program accepts computer equipment for a small fee or free HP printing supplies. </li>
                   <li>Retailer Recycling Programs: Large retailers frequently provide recycling services for a range of electronic products. Check with local stores for available programs. </li>

                    <h4>Electronics should never be put in the Blue Bin (recycling) or garbage. The City of Toronto collects unwanted electronics for free to ensure they are disposed of safely, recycled and kept out of landfill. Electronic items can be put out on garbage day for pickup, brought to a Drop-Off Depot or Community Environment Day or donated for reuse. For additional drop-off locations for electronics, visit the <a class="two" href="https://rpra.ca/where-to-recycle/" target="_blank">Resources Productivity & Recovery Authority</a>
